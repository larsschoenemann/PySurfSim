# PySurfSim
Framework for ultra-precision surface simulation.
## Description
This framework allows for the numerical simulation of nanoscale surfaces generated by ultra-precision cutting processes.

### Functions
`genSurfaceMesh`: generate a surface mesh of equal height using lateral dimensions together with a resolution or a fixed number of points/pixels
`applyMeshToolToWorkpiece`: apply a flycutting tool to a workpiece
`sliceSurface`: divide surface mesh into smaller patches
`combineSurface`: combine patches into larger surface mesh
`meshToolFlyCut`: provides the tool function for a flycutting tool
`getToolFootprint`: provides the footprint of a flycutting tool

## Usage

 1. Generate a new surface mesh using `genSurfaceMesh` or take a previously generated surface mesh as input
 2. Define tool apex positions as a mesh
 3. [Optional]: Divide surface mesh into smaller patches for parallel processing (e.g. via `joblib`) by using `sliceSurface`
 4. Apply tool function (e.g. `meshToolFlyCut`) to the surface mesh at the defined tool positions using `applyMeshToolToWorkpiece`
 5. [Optional]: Combine previously sliced surfaces by using `combineSurface`

## ToDo
- Use class-based tool description that provides the tool function as well as the footprint
